# MineGCG

MineGCG is a command line tool that computes statistics
for annotated cross-tables.com games. Currently, this
tool only works for UNIX-based operating systems that
ship with perl (this includes MacOS and Linux).
To use, navigate to a desired empty directory and run
the following commands:

git clone https://github.com/jvc56/MineGCG<br/>
cd MineGCG<br/>
chmod +x *.pl<br/>
./main.pl<br/>

A usage message telling you how to use the command should appear.
This tool is still a work in progress, so if you find any bugs
or want to suggest improvements, email them to joshuacastellano7@gmail.com
