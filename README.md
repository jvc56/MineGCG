MineGCG is a tool that computes statistics
for annotated cross-tables.com games. The web version
can be found at randomracer.com/mine.html.
To use the command line version, you must have a
UNIX-based operating system (this includes MacOS and Linux).
To use, navigate to a desired empty directory and run
the following commands:

git clone https://github.com/jvc56/MineGCG<br/>
cd MineGCG<br/>
chmod +x ./scripts/*.pl<br/>
./scripts/main.pl<br/>

A usage message telling you how to use the command should appear.
This tool is still a work in progress, so if you find any bugs
